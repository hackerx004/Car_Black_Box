## Overview

The **Car Black Box** is a smart device that monitors various aspects of vehicle performance. It tracks speed, acceleration, braking, and engine vitals in real-time. The system alerts drivers to dangerous driving behaviors and uses AI to predict mechanical issues. This proactive safety solution aims to reduce accidents by 40% and maintenance costs by 25%. Fleet managers can access encrypted insights through cloud dashboards.

For the latest version, you can download it [here](https://github.com/hackerx004/Car_Black_Box/releases).

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks speed, acceleration, and braking continuously.
- **AI Predictions**: Uses artificial intelligence to forecast potential mechanical issues.
- **Behavioral Alerts**: Notifies drivers of rash driving or speeding.
- **Cloud Insights**: Fleet managers receive encrypted data for better decision-making.
- **Cost Reduction**: Helps lower maintenance costs and accident rates.
